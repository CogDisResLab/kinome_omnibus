# Analytical Approaches

The PamStation&reg; 12 Platform generates a large amount of data in a single experiment. The raw data obtained from the platform includes fluorescence intensity values for each well, at each cycle and exposure level. This data is rich in information, but in its raw form, it cannot be easily interpreted without further processing. The preprocessing step transforms the raw image data into fluorescence intensity values that can be analyzed using various computational methods. In this chapter, we outline different analytical approaches that can be taken to extract meaningful insights from the processed data. These approaches include upstream kinase analysis, unsupervised and supervised clustering methods, statistical approaches, pathway analysis, and visualization techniques. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of each approach. Through the use of these analytical approaches, we can uncover hidden patterns and relationships in the data and gain a deeper understanding of kinase signaling pathways.

[Chapter -@sec-case-study] will walk us through all of the approaches outlined here on an example dataset.


## Approaches

The approaches to analyze the data are driven by two related questions:

1. Which kinases are the most important kinases in my sample?
2. What, if any, are the functional consequences of perturbing a particular kinase?

A well-designed experiment can attempt to answer both these question within the same experiment. However, it is also possible to design separate experiments for each of these questions.

To simplify the process, the analytical techniques can be divided into three broad buckets:

1. Upstream Kinase Identification Techniques
2. Kinase Pathway Analysis Techniques
3. Visualization and Summarization Techniques
