    "text": "Kinases are essential regulatory proteins that play a pivotal role in numerous biological processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle control, and gene expression. Dysregulation of kinase activity has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders (Manning et al. 2002).\nWhile measuring kinase expression levels can provide some insight into their biological function, it is crucial to assess kinase activity levels for a more accurate understanding of their role in biological processes (Zhang, Yang, and Gray 2009). Research has shown that protein expression is poorly correlated with protein abundance and subsequent activity (Smail, Reigle, and McCullumsmith 2021). Kinase activity profiling allows for the detection of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, that regulate kinase activity and, therefore, better represents the actual functional state of the kinase in the cell (Mann and Jensen 2003).\nIt is also essential to consider the redundancy and fault-tolerant nature of kinase signaling networks. In many cases, multiple kinases can activate the same downstream target, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact kinase responsible for a particular phenotype (Zhang, Yang, and Gray 2009). Therefore, screening multiple kinases simultaneously can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex signaling networks involved in a particular biological process.\nTo enable simultaneous profiling of kinase activity for hundreds of protein kinases in complex biological samples, the PamStation12 microarray platform has been developed. This platform uses peptide array technology, such as the serine/threonine (STK) and phospho-tyrosine (PTK) chips from PamGene, to provide high-throughput and multiplexed analysis of kinase activity (Tacken et al. 2005; McLaggan et al. 2006; Vepachedu et al. 2005).\n\n\n\n\nMann, Matthias, and Ole N.

Each chip contains four wells, with each well being capable of processing a single sample. Figure 2.2 shows a typical PamChip® 4\nThe basic design of the chips is the same but they differ in the individual reporter peptides that are printed on the chip. The basic design of the chip can be seen in Figure 2.2. The chip is approximately as long as a credit card and has 4 wells. Each well can be used for one sample.\nFigure 2.1 explains the logical construct of the chip. In each well of a chip, there is a grid of either 144 (for STK) or 196 (for PTK) peptides known to be substrates for kinases. Each spot has ∼ 300, 000 copies of the same peptide printed on it. The PamStation® 12 instrument accepts 3 chips of one kinds, either PTK or STK. The instrument then goes through several cycles of sample injection and washing. Once sufficient time has been given to the process, a flourescent antibody is added to the chip to allow for visualization. This allows for real-time capture of the activity based on the fluorescence levels. The STK chip requires two different antibodies to achieve fluorescence. The different mechanisms are summarized in Figure 2.3."

    "text": "2.2 Kinase Coverage in PamChip® 4\nThe PamGene platform provides coverage for a substantial proportion of the human kinome, enabling a comprehensive analysis of kinase activity. Specifically, the STK and PTK chips have been designed to cover a large number of Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases, respectively. It has been reported that the STK and PTK chips can map approximately 65% and 96% of the known human Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases, respectively (Manning et al. 2002). Furthermore, the platform is able to detect about 18 out of 21 (86%) of the dual specificity kinases (Manning et al. 2002). This broad coverage enables researchers to simultaneously screen the activity of multiple kinases, providing a more complete understanding of the biological system being studied.\nAdditionally, the STK chip has been shown to have sensitivity for detection into the picogram range for many kinases (Manning et al. 2002). The coverage of kinases in the STK chip is also representative of the abundance of protein kinases in neurons. A study based on the Brainseq neuron database (https://www.brainrnaseq.org/) showed that the STK chip covers similar amounts of low (52%), medium (65%), and high (65%) abundance protein kinases in neurons (Sousa et al. 2017).\nTaken together, these findings demonstrate that the PamGene platform provides a comprehensive and sensitive tool for studying kinase activity in a wide range of biological systems.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: A close-up view of a PamChip® 4"

    "text": "2.4 Key Advantages\nThe Pamstation® 12 has several key advantages over other kinase activity profiling methods. First, the platform allows for unbiased detection of kinase activity, as it does not rely on prior knowledge of kinase-substrate interactions. Second, the real-time detection of kinase activity allows for the precise measurement of kinetic parameters, such as reaction rates and enzyme efficiency. Third, the platform is highly sensitive and can detect changes in kinase activity even in complex biological samples, such as cell lysates and tissue homogenates.\nThe Pamstation® 12 has been widely used in a variety of research fields, including cancer biology, neuroscience, and plant biology. For example, the platform has been used to study the activity of kinases in breast cancer cells and to identify potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Additionally, the Pamstation® 12 has been used to profile the kinome of Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant organism, and to gain insights into the regulation of plant development and stress responses.\nIn summary, the PamGene PamStation twelve is a powerful tool for the high-throughput profiling of kinase activity. The platform offers several advantages over other methods, including unbiased detection of kinase activity, real-time measurement of kinetic parameters, and high sensitivity for complex biological samples. The Pamstation® 12 is a registered trademark of PamGene International B.V. and has been widely used in diverse research fields to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex biological processes.\n\n\n\n\nBreitkreutz, Dylan, Lynn Hlatky, Edward Rietman, and Jack A.

    "text": "4.1 Approaches\nThe analysis of data obtained from the PamStation® 12 platform can help answer two key questions: which kinases are the most important in a given sample, and what functional consequences arise from perturbing a particular kinase? Although a well-designed experiment can address both questions simultaneously, it is also possible to conduct separate experiments for each. To analyze the data and derive meaningful insights, a range of analytical techniques can be employed.\nThese techniques can be broadly divided into three categories: upstream kinase identification techniques, kinase pathway analysis techniques, and visualization and summarization techniques. Upstream kinase identification techniques seek to identify the kinases that are responsible for the observed changes in phosphorylation levels, typically by perturbing the system and then using statistical methods to identify the kinases whose activity changes significantly. Kinase pathway analysis techniques aim to identify the pathways that are affected by kinase perturbations, using either experimental data or existing knowledge of kinase signaling networks. Visualization and summarization techniques enable the visualization of complex data sets and summarization of key findings, providing a means of communicating results to others.\nEach of these categories includes several techniques that can be tailored to the specific research question and experimental design. The following sections will elaborate on each category and provide examples of the techniques that fall within each."

Usually this is the phosphorylation data from the final cycle of the array run.\nFor each individual sample, define a variable that will summarise the phosphorylation level of that peptide.\nIdentify how the phosphorylation status changes with respect to a control group\nUse either experimental, literature-based or computational predictions for possible kinases upstream of a particular peptide and use a statistical model to identify the most prominent ones.\n\nThere are four available packages that allow us to do upstream kinase identification.
