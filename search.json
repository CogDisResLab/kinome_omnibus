    "text": "Kinases are essential regulatory proteins that play a pivotal role in numerous biological processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle control, and gene expression. Dysregulation of kinase activity has been implicated in various human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders (Manning et al. 2002).\nWhile measuring kinase expression levels can provide some insight into their biological function, it is crucial to assess kinase activity levels for a more accurate understanding of their role in biological processes (Zhang, Yang, and Gray 2009). Research has shown that protein expression is poorly correlated with protein abundance and subsequent activity (Smail, Reigle, and McCullumsmith 2021). Kinase activity profiling allows for the detection of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, that regulate kinase activity and, therefore, better represents the actual functional state of the kinase in the cell (Mann and Jensen 2003).\nIt is also essential to consider the redundancy and fault-tolerant nature of kinase signaling networks. In many cases, multiple kinases can activate the same downstream target, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact kinase responsible for a particular phenotype (Zhang, Yang, and Gray 2009). Therefore, screening multiple kinases simultaneously can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex signaling networks involved in a particular biological process.\nTo enable simultaneous profiling of kinase activity for hundreds of protein kinases in complex biological samples, the PamStation12 microarray platform has been developed. This platform uses peptide array technology, such as the serine/threonine (STK) and phospho-tyrosine (PTK) chips from PamGene, to provide high-throughput and multiplexed analysis of kinase activity (Tacken et al. 2005; McLaggan et al. 2006; Vepachedu et al. 2005).\n\n\n\n\nMann, Matthias, and Ole N.

Each chip contains four wells, with each well being capable of processing a single sample. Figure 2.2 shows a typical PamChip® 4\nThe basic design of the chips is the same but they differ in the individual reporter peptides that are printed on the chip. The basic design of the chip can be seen in Figure 2.2. The chip is approximately as long as a credit card and has 4 wells. Each well can be used for one sample.\nFigure 2.1 explains the logical construct of the chip. In each well of a chip, there is a grid of either 144 (for STK) or 196 (for PTK) peptides known to be substrates for kinases. Each spot has ∼ 300, 000 copies of the same peptide printed on it. The PamStation® 12 instrument accepts 3 chips of one kinds, either PTK or STK. The instrument then goes through several cycles of sample injection and washing. Once sufficient time has been given to the process, a flourescent antibody is added to the chip to allow for visualization. This allows for real-time capture of the activity based on the fluorescence levels. The STK chip requires two different antibodies to achieve fluorescence. The different mechanisms are summarized in Figure 2.3."

Specifically, the STK and PTK chips have been designed to cover a large number of Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases, respectively. It has been reported that the STK and PTK chips can map approximately 65% and 96% of the known human Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases, respectively (Manning et al. 2002). Furthermore, the platform is able to detect about 18 out of 21 (86%) of the dual specificity kinases (Manning et al. 2002). This broad coverage enables researchers to simultaneously screen the activity of multiple kinases, providing a more complete understanding of the biological system being studied.\nAdditionally, the STK chip has been shown to have sensitivity for detection into the picogram range for many kinases (Manning et al. 2002). The coverage of kinases in the STK chip is also representative of the abundance of protein kinases in neurons. A study based on the Brainseq neuron database (https://www.brainrnaseq.org/) showed that the STK chip covers similar amounts of low (52%), medium (65%), and high (65%) abundance protein kinases in neurons (Sousa et al. 2017).\nTaken together, these findings demonstrate that the PamGene platform provides a comprehensive and sensitive tool for studying kinase activity in a wide range of biological systems.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: A close-up view of a PamChip® 4"

    "text": "2.4 Key Advantages\nThe Pamstation® 12 has several key advantages over other kinase activity profiling methods. First, the platform allows for unbiased detection of kinase activity, as it does not rely on prior knowledge of kinase-substrate interactions. Second, the real-time detection of kinase activity allows for the precise measurement of kinetic parameters, such as reaction rates and enzyme efficiency. Third, the platform is highly sensitive and can detect changes in kinase activity even in complex biological samples, such as cell lysates and tissue homogenates.\nThe Pamstation® 12 has been widely used in a variety of research fields, including cancer biology, neuroscience, and plant biology. For example, the platform has been used to study the activity of kinases in breast cancer cells and to identify potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Additionally, the Pamstation® 12 has been used to profile the kinome of Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant organism, and to gain insights into the regulation of plant development and stress responses.\nIn summary, the PamGene PamStation twelve is a powerful tool for the high-throughput profiling of kinase activity. The platform offers several advantages over other methods, including unbiased detection of kinase activity, real-time measurement of kinetic parameters, and high sensitivity for complex biological samples.

    "text": "4.3 Pathway Analysis\nWhile identification of kinases is important and useful in its own right, understanding the functional consequences of the kinase activity is equally, if not more important. For this purpose, we can utilize various databases that have collected and curated functional information about the genes. This question makes the core of pathway analysis (Khatri, Sirota, and Butte 2012).\nFor pathway analysis, there are two different approaches that rely on different results: utilizing the substrate activity for identifying downstream pathways or utilizing the identified kinases for identifying downstream pathways.\nFor both cases, the general workflow is as follows:\n\nIdentify the genes that have been impacted in the experiment, either by a threshold or by a proportional measure.\nIdentify the relevant database that has the information you need.\nUse the particular database’s interface to upload the gene data and scores if necessary to get the list of enriched pathways.\n\nSeveral pathway analysis tools are available, such as Reactome (Gillespie et al. 2021; Griss et al. 2020; Jassal et al. 2019; Fabregat et al. 2018; Fabregat, Sidiropoulos, Viteri, Marin-Garcia, et al. 2017; Sidiropoulos et al. 2017; Fabregat, Sidiropoulos, Viteri, Forner, et al. 2017; Wu and Haw 2017), KEGG (M. Kanehisa 2000; Minoru Kanehisa 2019; Minoru Kanehisa et al. 2022), and GO enrichment analysis (Ashburner et al. 2000; Carbon et al. 2020). These databases provide curated pathway annotations and functional analysis of the genes, making it easier to interpret the results obtained from PamGene data analysis.\nReactome is a database of manually curated pathway information, and it provides a web-based interface for the analysis of gene lists. The software can analyze the gene list and identify enriched pathways based on the input data (Gillespie et al. 2021; Griss et al. 2020; Jassal et al. 2019; Fabregat et al. 2018; Fabregat, Sidiropoulos, Viteri, Marin-Garcia, et al. 2017; Sidiropoulos et al. 2017; Fabregat, Sidiropoulos, Viteri, Forner, et al. 2017; Wu and Haw 2017).\nKEGG is another database for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as the cell, the organism, and the ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies (M. Kanehisa 2000; Minoru Kanehisa 2019; Minoru Kanehisa et al. 2022).\nGO enrichment analysis is another pathway analysis technique that is widely used. It is used to determine whether certain GO terms (i.e., biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions) are overrepresented in the list of genes. This method helps to identify which GO terms are most impacted by the gene list and can provide a comprehensive understanding of the biological context of the analyzed data (Ashburner et al. 2000; Carbon et al. 2020)."

    "text": "4.4 Visualization and Summarization\nIn analyzing the large amount of data generated by the primary data and subsequent analyses, it is often necessary to summarize the data in a figure to aid in interpretation. One commonly used way to summarize global kinase activity is through the use of a row-scaled heatmap. This type of heatmap allows for the clustering of both samples and peptides, which can identify homogeneity within samples and functional clusters of peptides. This is particularly useful for analyzing activity across all the samples and peptides present on the chip.\nAnother effective way to summarize global activity is through boxplots or violin plots of all the peptides in a given sample. These plots can be split by barcodes and group membership to showcase differences and heterogeneity, respectively. This approach allows for the visualization of the distribution of activity across peptides and provides insight into the level of variation within each sample.\nFor group comparisons, a waterfall plot can be used to show the change in activity between two groups. This type of plot shows individual changes in peptide activity between two groups, with the change on the x-axis and the peptides on the y-axis. Replicates, if present, can be plotted on the same line with an additional “mean” change dot plotted in the middle. This type of plot can help to identify differences in activity between groups and highlight potential biomarkers.\nHeatmaps are also useful for group comparisons, where only the samples of interest are kept and the data is normalized among them. These group-specific heatmaps are similar to the global heatmaps but contain only the two designated groups. This allows for an easier comparison between the two groups, while also highlighting differences in activity. Overall, the choice of figure type will depend on the research question and the type of data being analyzed.\n\n\n\n\nAshburner, Michael, Catherine A. Ball, Judith A.
